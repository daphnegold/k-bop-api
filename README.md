Finding new K-Pop can be hard. Especially if you're new to the genre! Get your swiping finger ready cause we're gonna get you started with some awesome songs. Have a nice K-Pop adventure!

###Target Audience
This app targets current Spotify users that are curious about the K-Pop genre or K-Pop lovers wanting to build an ultimate playlist and discover new songs quickly.

###MVP Features

*What do?*  
SHAKE IT, shake, shake it!

- view your results, swipe right or left to like or dislike a song, respectively

###Market Research
There are a few snap-judgement playlist builders available that utilize the Spotify API.
[Spotlst](http://spotlst.com/) (Tinder-like playlist builder)
[VidFish](http://www.vid.fish/) (Music video playlists)
[MagicPlaylist](http://magicplaylist.co/) (Enter an Artist, get a playlist)

Some market feedback indicates users want a simple to use, bare-bones application interface. My app will keep things simple but provide more robust functionality than any of the apps listed above. Later versions will integrate Spotify and Youtube content.
