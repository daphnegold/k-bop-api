# Product Plan

Finding new K-Pop can be hard. Especially if you're new to the genre! Get your swiping finger ready cause we're gonna get you started with some awesome songs. Have a nice K-Pop adventure!

###Target Audience
This app targets current Spotify users that are curious about the K-Pop genre or K-Pop lovers wanting to get out of their usual music routine and discover new content ***quickly***.

###Market Research
There are a few snap-judgement playlist builders available that utilize the Spotify API.
[Spotlst](http://spotlst.com/)
Tinder-like playlist builder. Users get random content suggestions and like or dislike the sample. Users can get the same song suggestions repeatedly.

[VidFish](http://www.vid.fish/)
This app creates video playlists from your already-existing playlists or creates one based on genre / artist. An embedded player loads where you can watch the selected videos.

[MagicPlaylist](http://magicplaylist.co/)
Enter your favorite song, get a playlist of related tunes. Sample them by clicking and save the list to Spotify.

Some market feedback indicates users want a simple to use, bare-bones application interface. My app will keep things simple but provide more robust functionality when it comes to personalization than any of the apps listed above. Later versions will integrate Spotify and Youtube content. Yay, synchronized dancing!
